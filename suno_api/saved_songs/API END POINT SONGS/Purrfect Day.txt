[Verse]
Fluffy paws and tiny toes
Whiskers twitch wherever it goes
Chasing shadows light and fast
This silly cat makes the fun last
[Verse 2]
Knocks a vase onto the floor
Sits and stares like it’s not sure
Paws the curtains climbs up high
Kitty thinks it can touch the sky
[Chorus]
Meow meow let’s all play
Jumping spinning every day
Furry friends with tails that sway
Cats make every purrfect day
[Verse 3]
They hide inside the laundry bin
Peek their head a sheepish grin
Stealing socks with ninja flair
Who needs toys when fun’s right there
[Bridge]
Purring softly in the sun
Dreaming dreams of mice to run
Curling up all snug and tight
Kitty sleeps all through the night
[Chorus]
Meow meow let’s all play
Jumping spinning every day
Furry friends with tails that sway
Cats make every purrfect day
